# Parametric-method-PSD-estimation
This file constitued of code to parametric methed estimation of the PSD considering an AM (average mean) process and we apply it for the Erdos-Renyi graph with paramters N=100 and p=0.2, at the end we compare it to the non-parametric method.
The algorithm used for the optimizing problem is the least mean square algorithm.
